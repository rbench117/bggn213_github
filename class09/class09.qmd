##PDB Statistics

```{r}
library(readr)
data <- read_csv("Data_Export_Summary.csv")
data
```

```{r}
n.total <- sum(data$Total)
n.xray <- sum(data$`X-ray`)

round(n.xray/n.total * 100, 2)

n.em <- sum(data$EM)

round(n.em/n.total * 100, 2)
```


>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

81.43% of structures in PDB are solved by X-Ray, and 12.27% are made through EM

```{r}
n.protein <- c(176378, 20438, 12709, 342, 221, 83, 32)
n.protein2 <- sum(n.protein)
round(n.protein2/n.total)


```


>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein only?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Can use the `` marks for columns with subtypes like "Molecular Weight"

ggplot(data, aes(x = reorder(`Molecular Type`, Total), y = Total)) + geom_col()
```

>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

There are 4,866 structures in the search.

##Visualizing structure data

The Mol* viewer is embedded in many bioinformatics websites. The homepage is https://molstar.org/

I can insert any figure or image file using markdown format

>Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

We see one atom (oxygen) to represent water in these structures because X-ray crystallography usually does not detect hydrogen because of low electron density.

>Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

This water molecule is number 308.

>Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

See 1HSG 2.png above.

## Bio3D package for structural bioinformatics

We can use the bio3d package to read and analyze biomolecular data in R:

```{r}
library(bio3d)
hiv <- read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```

>Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

There are 198 amino acid residues in this pdb object.

>Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues?

Water is one of the two nin protein residues.

>Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?

There are 2 chains in the structure.

```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
```

Let's get the sequence

```{r}
pdbseq( hiv )
```

Let's trim to chain A and get just it's sequence:

```{r}
chainA <- trim.pdb( hiv, chain = "A")
chainA.seq <- pdbseq(chainA)
```

Let's blast 

```{r blast_hiv, cache=TRUE}
blast <- blast.pdb(chainA.seq)
```

```{r}
head(blast$hit.tbl)
```

Plot a quick overview of blast results

```{r}
hits <- plot(blast)
```

```{r}
hits$pdb.id
```

##Prediction of functional motions

We can run an Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) to rpedict large scale motions/flexibility/dynamics of any biomolecule that we can read into R

Let's look at ADK and chain A only!

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("1ake")

adk_A <- trim.pdb(adk, chain = "A")
adk_A
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk_A)
plot(m)
```

Let's write out a "trajectory" of predicted motion:

```{r}
mktrj(m, file = "adk_nma.pdb")
```

## PLay with 3D viewing in R

We can use the new **bio3dview** package, which is not yet on CRAN, to render interactive 3D views in R and HTML quarto output reports

To install from GitHub we can use the **pak** package.

```{r}
#library(bio3dview)

#view.pdb(adk)
```

>Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN?

msa is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN

>Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?:

The package bio3d-view is not found on BioConductir or CRAN.

>Q12. True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket? 

True

##Search and retrieve ADK structures

```{r}
library(bio3d)
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```

>Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence?

There are 214 amino acids in this sequence.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
hits <- plot(b)
```

```{r}
# List out some 'top hits'
head(hits$pdb.id)
```

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

```{r}
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

```{r, cache = TRUE}

pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")

```

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
ids <- basename.pdb(pdbs$id)

plot(pdbs, labels=ids)
```

```{r}
anno <- pdb.annotate(ids)
unique(anno$source)
```

```{r}
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
rd <- rmsd(pdbs)

hc.rd <- hclust(dist(rd))
grps.rd <- cutree(hc.rd, k=3)

plot(pc.xray, 1:2, col="grey50", bg=grps.rd, pch=21, cex=1)
```


##Comparative Analysis of protein structures

Starting with a sequence or structure ID (accession number) let's run a complete analysis pipeline

```{r}
library(bio3d)

id <- "1ake_A"

aa <- get.seq(id)
aa
```

```{r, cache = TRUE}
blast <- blast.pdb(aa)

hits <- plot(blast)
```

```{r}
hits$pdb.id
```

Download all these "hits" that are similar to our starting id sequence

```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```
```{r}
# Align releated PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

```{r}
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
plot(pc.xray, 1:2)
```

```{r}
mktrj(pc.xray, file = "pca_results.pdb")
```

```{r}
library(bio3dview)

view.pca(pc.xray)
```


install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("msa")
